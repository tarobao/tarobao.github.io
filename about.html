            Hey... I'm EMMA &#x1F47A;&#xFE0E; 
          </h1>
          <p>As of now, I'm currently an undergraduate student (trying to survive a potential visual arts/computer science major) + amateur artist + part-time graphic designer. I'm not really sure if these biographies should be written in the first person or not, and to be quite honest I kind of dislike the way it sounds right now. I'm kind of boring otherwise. I also hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio, and that the excessive use of pronouns at the start of these sentences didn't really annoy you too much. Either way, grammar is fake and colonial, so it doesn't really matter if you did.
